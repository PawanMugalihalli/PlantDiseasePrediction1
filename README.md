Plant Disease Prediction using ResNet-18 model

Description about this project:

  This project trains a machine learning model to classify plant diseases based on images of plant leaves. It uses a labeled dataset of plant images, where each image is categorized by disease type. The model is trained to learn patterns in these images that are specific to each disease.
  *** The dataset contains 10 classes including diseased and healthy leaves of Tomato crop***
  Input (Plant Images): The project uses these labeled images to train the ResNet-18 model to recognize specific features associated with different diseases.
  Output (Trained Model and Metrics): The trained model can then be used to predict the disease in new, unlabeled plant images. The modelâ€™s accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix provide insights into its performance, showing how well it distinguishes between different diseases.
  In essence, the project builds a classifier that can help identify plant diseases from new images, potentially assisting farmers or agricultural experts in diagnosing plant health issues.

Steps to execute the program: Method 1

  Open this link for the kaggle 'dataset': https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pawanmugalihalli/plantvillagedataset2
  It will take you to Kaggle dateset 'plantvillagedataset2'.
  Click on 'New Notebook', it will create a kaggle notebook.
  Go to settings -> Go to Accelerator -> Select any one of the GPUs (if available).
  Copy the python file from vpl and past it here in one cell.
  Run it.
